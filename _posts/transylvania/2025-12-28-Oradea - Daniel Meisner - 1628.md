#### Description ####
Copper engraved panoramic view of the city and fortress of Oradea, with the Crișul Repede River flowing through it. The work is titled "GENS DEDITA CHRISTO" ("A People Devoted to Christ") and also includes the caption "Waradin. in Ungarn".

Translation:
 
GENS DEDITA CHRISTO
Dedita gens Chrifto bona tantum curat amatge
Das Volck welches dem Berrer Shrift Sewidmet und ergeben ist
Cælica, et ardenti flagrat amore Dei
In Gottes Lieb brent es fo fein
 
A People Devoted to Christ
The people dedicated to Christ cares for and loves only good things
The people who are dedicated and devoted to the Lord Christ
And she burns with a heavenly and ardent love for God
She burns so intensely in the love of God
 
The view was first edited in "Thesaurus philopoliticus" (also Thesaurus Philo-Politicus, Ger. Politisches Schatzkästlein) by Daniel Meisner, engraved and published by Eberhard Kieser from 1623 in Frankfurt am Main. The emblematic images, in the first place, were intended to "enlighten and educate the reader and guide him through a better transition". Always place in the lower part, a text (in ancient German or Latin), related to the represented. The work, which in the first edition only included 52 views, after its instant release, the editors expanded the same items and so in 1631, they included a total of 830 views. After Kieser's death in the same year, the plates were bought by an art dealer from Nuremberg, Paulust Furst, who added the letters and numbers on the right side of the page (each letter A-H for a volume and the number 1-100 marks a page in a volume). Meisner's first edition, Fürst's revised work was an instant success. The views of this work pertain to the classic miniature views of the XVII century.
 
The poet Daniel Meisner from Komotau started his "Thesaurus Philo-Politicus. Das ist Politisches Schatzkästlein guter Herren und bestendiger Freund…" in Frankfurt in 1623, initially in parts, each one containing about fifty plans. The work was printed work by Eberhard Kieser. In 1678 the collection of copperplates was sold to Paul Fü, who continued the printing under same title.
By 1625 the collection included 362 views which had increased to 800 the end of the century, when the last edition was published.
