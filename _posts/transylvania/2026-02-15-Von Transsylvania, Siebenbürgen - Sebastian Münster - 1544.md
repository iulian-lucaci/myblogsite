Sebastian Münster (1488 - 1552) was a German cartographer, cosmographer, and professor at the University of Basel. His major work, the Cosmographia (first published 1544), was one of the most successful and widely reprinted geographical books of the 16th century. It utilized thousands of woodcuts to illustrate the cities, maps, customs, and natural history of the world.
