#### Title ####
George II Rákóczi 1657, Dahlberg, Pufendorf - 1697

#### Description ####
Depiction of the encounter between the Prince of Transylvania, George II Rakoczi (1621-1660) and the Swedish King Karl X Gustav (1622-1660) on April 7th, 1657 in Poland. 
The ruler of Transylvania concluded an alliance against the Kingdom of Poland without consulting the Sublime Porte in Istanbul, 
whereby the war ended in catastrophe after initial successes for the troops from Transylvania. 
In the front right, the Swedish king welcomes his allies in front of his tent. 
The scene is watched by numerous Swedish soldiers and Transylvanian nobles (in their characteristic fashion on the left edge of the picture). 
In the background on the left you can see the camp of the two armies. In the middle of the top edge is a cartouche with the Latin title and 
a legend about the people involved, with a portrait of the Swedish king above it. Two genies with the coat of arms of the Kingdom of Sweden are 
hovering at the top left. At the bottom, two lions flank the ligated monogram of the Swedish king. In the lower left corner is the name of the 
draftsman of the composition, Erik Dahlberg (1625-1703), who drew the event on site. At the bottom right is the printed signature of the engraver
Jean Lepautre (1618-1682). An engraved frame runs around the depiction. Plate 50 from the work published posthumously in Nuremberg in 1697 
by the Riegel publishing house:Sieben Bücher von denen Thaten Carl Gustavs Königs in Schweden...by the author Samuel von Pufendorf (1632-1694). 
With numerous etchings, the work documents the battles during the Second Northern War, in which Sweden invaded Poland-Lithuania.
Many of the preliminary drawings for the illustrations in this work are by Erik Dahlberg (1625-1703).
